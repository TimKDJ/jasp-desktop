# Guidelines for creating a pull request to a module

This document will guide you through the checklist you see when you open a pull request.

### "I have ensured my code follows the style guidelines"
We created a set of guidelines for our R analyses to ensure each module has a consistent style of coding.
An example of this is the use of camelCasing in variable names instead of using snake_case.
The guidelines can be found here: https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-desktop/blob/development/Docs/development/r-style-guide.md

### "I have updated the help files"
Each analysis has a dedicated help file that allows JASP users to understand what each input option does and how the output should be interpreted.
It's important that when we make changes to these options or the output that the help files accurately reflects this.
An example of this would be changing a column from showing the mean to the median, but failing to update the help file will result in the user being misinformed.

Each change to the QML should be reflected in a change to the `info` property 

### "I have added unit tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works"
To make sure we don't accidentally break things we use unit tests.
It allows us to ensure that analysis results remain consistent and that bugs we fixed do not return.
The process to creating unit tests is described here: https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-desktop/blob/development/Docs/development/r-unit-test-guide.md

### "I have ensured the DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files are up-to-date"
Each module is a regular R package. This means dependencies and exports go in the customary DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files, respectively.
If you're unfamiliar with these files, a good explanation can be found in the online book "R packages" by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.
DESCRIPTION: https://r-pkgs.org/description.html
NAMESPACE: https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html

What you need to do is make sure that if you add, replace or delete a package, that this information is recorded in the DESCRIPTION file.
You should adjust the NAMESPACE file if you want a module to export a certain function.
To exemplify this, imagine if module A has a function `mean()` you'd like to use in module B.
You would need to adjust the NAMESPACE file of module A and add `export(mean)`, then in module B you should adjust the DESCRIPTION file to add an import of module A.

### "My commit messages clearly summarize the changes I made"
Each module has a commit history that is basically the story of everything that has been changed to it:

It's a very useful source of information to figure out who worked on what and when certain features were introduced.
However, if a commit message states something like "fixed a bug" it does not convey any useful information.

A commit has two aspects:
- the message: this should be a short summary of your changes. Write your commit message with a capital and in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.
- the description: here you can insert the links of the issues your commit implements (e.g., Fixes jasp-stats/INTERNAL-jasp#1155) and, optionally, clarify your changes further.
